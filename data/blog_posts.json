Torsion springs, located above the garage door on a metal shaft, work by storing mechanical energy when the door is closed through twisting, and releasing this energy to help lift the door when opening.</p>\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n<strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Never attempt to fix garage door springs yourself. Due to the high tension in the springs, spring repairs should only be handled by professional technicians to avoid dangerous hazards. Springs have the most tension when the door is lowered.\n</div>\n\n<h3>Types of Spring Systems</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Torsion Springs:</strong> Located above the door, visible and easier to inspect</li>\n    <li><strong>Wayne Dalton System:</strong> Springs located inside a hollow tube, making inspection more difficult</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Warning Signs for Replacement</h3>\n<p>Watch for these critical signs that indicate your springs need professional attention:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Door becomes unusually heavy and difficult to open manually</li>\n    <li>Door opens partially or very slowly</li>\n    <li>Door drops quickly when partially lifted</li>\n    <li>Springs show visible rust or corrosion</li>\n    <li>Loud bang sounds due to springs unwinding quickly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Factors Affecting Spring Lifespan</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Regular wear and tear</li>\n    <li>Rust and corrosion</li>\n    <li>Incorrect maintenance</li>\n    <li>Environmental conditions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n<strong>Professional Tip:</strong> Annual maintenance by trained professionals can help identify spring issues early and prevent costly repairs or accidents.\n</div>\n",
